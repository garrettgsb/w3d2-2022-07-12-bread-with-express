/*
  Resources are the nouns of your app
  You can think of resources as Collections and Entities
  e.g. "The Todos collection" vs. "A Todo entity"

  CRUD - Create Read Update Delete
  BREAD - Browse Read Edit Add Delete

  In BREAD:
  Reading a collection is Browse
  Reading an entity is Read

REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer
(That's not a super helpful term in this context... Also a much broader concept than just routing)

"RESTful routing" is about doing BREAD stuff to Resources in a predictable way.
So if I know what my resources are, then I already know what the routes should be.
Not a strict rule-- People deviate from RESTful routing practices all the time, and that's okay.
But if you follow it when you can, your code will be easier to work with, for you and others,
by being predictable and consistent. Boring, in a good way :)

Browse - GET '/resources'
Read - GET '/resources/:id'
Edit - POST '/resources/:id'
Add - POST '/resources'
Delete - POST '/resources/:id/delete' (or DELETE '/resources/:id')

Browse - GET '/chefs'
Read - GET '/chefs/:id'
Edit - POST '/chefs/:id'
Add - POST '/chefs'
Delete - POST '/chefs/:id/delete' (or DELETE '/chefs/:id')

Browse - GET '/recipes'
Read - GET '/recipes/:id'
Edit - POST '/recipes/:id'
Add - POST '/recipes'
Delete - POST '/recipes/:id/delete' (or DELETE '/recipes/:id')

Browse - GET '/comments'
Read - GET '/comments/:id'
Edit - POST '/comments/:id'
Add - POST '/comments'
Delete - POST '/comments/:id/delete' (or DELETE '/comments/:id')
